# Automated Deployment Works!

This post was created to test the GitHub Actions automatic deployment pipeline.

## What Happened

1. Created a new post in `content/posts/`
2. Pushed to GitHub
3. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Built the blog
   - Deployed to FTP server
4. Website is now updated! 🎉

## Next Steps

You can now:
- Create new posts anytime
- Push to `main` branch
- Automatic deployment happens instantly

No more manual FTP uploads needed! 🚀

**Happy blogging!**
